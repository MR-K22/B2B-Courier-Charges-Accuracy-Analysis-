# B2B-Courier-Charges-Accuracy-Analysis-
Project Overview
This project assesses the accuracy of courier fees charged in B2B deliveries. It uses multiple datasets like order reports, SKU details, pincodes, courier invoices, and rate sheets to calculate expected shipping charges and compares them with actual billed amounts. The analysis identifies discrepancies—overcharges, undercharges, and correct charges—to ensure fair billing and optimize costs.
